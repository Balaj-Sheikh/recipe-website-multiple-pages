    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
<li><b>Prepare the mutton mixture:</b>
Boil the mutton for koftas in a pressure cooker with a little salt and 1 cup water. Once the mutton is soft and if any water remains, dry it on low flame. Now add 1 tsp each ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder, 1 tsp curd, besan, a pinch of turmeric and mix well. Use your hands to knead the koftas so that they become soft. Now make round, smooth balls. You can add more besan if the mixture is a bit too moist. Keep the koftas aside.</li>
<li><b>Shallow fry the koftas:</b>
    Heat oil in a non stick wok or pan and slowly drop the koftas and fry them on low flame till golden. Put in an absorbent paper and keep aside.</li>
    <li><b>Prepare the gravy:</b>
Next, put a kadhai on medium flame and heat 4- tablespoons of oil in it. Add cinnamon, cardamoms, clove and heeng (asafoetida). When the spices start spluttering, add the grated onion and cook till it turns pink. Now add the garlic paste and saut√© till the raw smell disappears. At this point add ginger, red chilli powder and turmeric along with salt and mix well. Keep the flame low or the spices will burn. Now beat the curd well so that no lumps remain and add it to the spice mixture. Keep stirring it continuously or the curd will curdle. Now add 1 to 2 cups water, depending on how thick you want your gravy. Now add the garam masala. Keep stirring till the gravy comes to a boil.</li>
<li><b>Add the spices to the gravy:</b>
Add the bay leaves in the gravy (you can also add them right at the beginning where you are adding the whole garam masalas). Slowly drop in the koftas now. Keep the flame low.</li>
<li><b>Allow the koftas to simmer:</b>
Lower the flame and allow the koftas to simmer for another 6-7 minutes. You will see a thin layer of oil on top which means the gravy is ready. Serve it hot with rice or butter naan.</li>
